# Perdisco
Definition (Verb): to learn thoroughly, to learn completely, to get by heart.

## Core Principles
1. **Active Recall**: Retrieving information strengthens memory more than passive review.
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit material at increasing intervals to combat forgetting.
3. **Feynman Technique**: Explaining concepts in simple terms uncovers gaps in understanding.
4. **Dual Coding**: Combine verbal/written explanations with visuals or diagrams.
5. **Interleaving**: Mix topics to improve discrimination and flexibility.

## Workflow
1. **Encode with Feynman + Flashcards**
    1. Before creating flashcards, try to explain the concept verbally or in writing as if teaching someone. Use analogies and mental images.
    2. Turn gaps from the Feynman attempt into question-driven flash cards.
        * For formulas: "Derive [formula] from [principle]."
        * For theorems: "Explain [theorem] in plain language and its implications."
    3. Iterate and enrich flashcards with visuals and diagrams where necessary.
2. **Active Recall & Spaced Repitition**
    * **Daily Reviews**: Prioritize cards you struggled with during Feynman attempts.
    * **Interleave Topic**: Shuffle cards within and across subjects.
    * **Graduated Intervals**: Use algorithm to space reviews (e.g., 1 day → 3 days → 1 week).
3. **Deepen Understanding with Feynman Checkpoints**
    * Tailor the ratio of flashcards to Feynman checkpoint sessions based on topic complexity (e.g., spend more time teaching proofs than formulas).
    * Weekly Teach-Aloud Sessions:
        * Pick 2–3 important concepts from recent flashcards.
        * Explain them aloud without notes, then refine using the 3-step Feynman method:
            * Teach: Verbalize the concept simply.
            * Identify Gaps: Note where you falter or overcomplicate.
            * Relearn & Simplify: Return to sources, fill gaps, and re-explain.
    * Written Summaries: After mastering a topic, write a 1-paragraph "explainer" using analogies.
4. **Metacognition & Error Analysis**
    * Mistake Log: Track recurring errors (e.g., "Confused Theorem A with Theorem B").
    * Targeted SRS Tags: Flag error-prone cards in Anki for extra reviews.
    * Self-Testing: Every 2 weeks, solve novel problems (e.g., proofs, derivations) under timed conditions.

## Why This Works
* **Feynman + Active Recall**: Forces retrieval and deep processing (Chi et al., 1994 show self-explanation boosts learning).
* **Spacing** + Interleaving: Matches cognitive load to memory decay (Dunlosky, 2013).
* **Dual Coding**: Visuals + verbalization engage multiple memory pathways (Paivio, 1971).
