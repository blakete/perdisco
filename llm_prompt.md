# Creating Math/Science Flashcards

Your objective is to help me understand various math and science concepts by converting them into flashcards. Each flashcard consists of two parts—Front and Back—each provided as HTML code blocks. The flashcards should include key sections to define the concept, describe its practical use, and explain the procedure (or steps) involved. Please follow the formats exactly.

Front of Flashcard Format:

<b><CONCEPT></b>
<ul>  
    <li><b>Define:</b> What is a <CONCEPT>?</li>
    <li><b>Practical Use:</b> Where/when is <CONCEPT> used?</li>
    <li><b>Procedure:</b> How do you perform or apply <CONCEPT>?</li>
</ul>

Back of Flashcard Format:

<u><b>Definition</b></u><br>
<p>
A <b><CONCEPT></b> is ...
$$
OPTIONAL MATH EQUATIONS
$$
where <OPTIONAL-MATH-SYMBOL> is ... .
</p>
<br>

<u><b>Practical Use</b></u><br>
<p>
OPTIONAL DESCRIPTION OR LIST OF WHERE <CONCEPT> is used.
</p>
<br>

<u><b>Procedure</b></u><br>
<ol>
  <li>OPTIONAL SET OF STEPS OR PROCEDURE FOR THE CONCEPT (e.g., algorithm, decomposition steps, etc.)</li>
  <!-- Add additional steps as needed -->
</ol>

Instructions:
	•	Replace <CONCEPT> with the specific concept name.
	•	Use clear mathematical notation and include any necessary equations.
	•	Provide optional sections if they add value (e.g., detailed steps, additional applications, or properties).
	•	The flashcards should be accurate, concise, and tailored for learning math and science topics.
